    📋 PATHWAY'S ROLE IN OUR LIVE FINTECH AI ASSISTANT
    
    🎯 What is Pathway?
    Pathway is a Python framework for high-throughput, low-latency data processing.
    It's designed for real-time data streaming and event-driven architectures.
    
    🚀 What Pathway Does in Our Project:
    
    1. 📊 REAL-TIME STREAM PROCESSING
       - Continuously processes incoming stock price data
       - Creates live data streams that update automatically
       - Handles high-frequency data without blocking the system
    
    2. 🔄 EVENT-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE  
       - Triggers actions when significant price movements occur
       - Automatically correlates price changes with news events
       - Creates reactive data flows that respond to market changes
    
    3. ⚡ ULTRA-FAST DATA TRANSFORMATION
       - Transforms raw stock data into meaningful insights instantly
       - Processes multiple data streams concurrently
       - Maintains low-latency response times (< 1 second)
    
    4. 🧠 AI INTEGRATION PIPELINE
       - Automatically triggers AI explanations for significant movements
       - Correlates stock movements with relevant news articles
       - Creates intelligent data relationships in real-time
    
    5. 📈 CONTINUOUS MONITORING
       - Never stops monitoring - runs 24/7 during market hours
       - Automatically detects anomalies and significant changes
       - Maintains persistent state across system restarts

2. REAL-TIME PROCESSING:
   Every price update triggers immediate processing
   No waiting, no polling, no delays

3. INTELLIGENT FILTERING:
   Only process significant movements (> 5% change)
   Ignore noise, focus on important events

4. SCALABLE ARCHITECTURE:
   Adding more stocks = just more stream events
   No additional complexity or API overhead

5. FAULT TOLERANCE:
   Pathway handles failures, retries, state recovery
   System keeps running even during errors
